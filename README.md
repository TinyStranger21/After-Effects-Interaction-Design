# After-Effects-Interaction-Design

I wanted to add more motion design to my SilverWear spoon ring website. In order to do that, I utilized after effects to create two interactions for my website.

## Interaction 1

The first interaction I made was an endless animation that would act as my hover state for the spoon ring purchasing pages.

I started this with a few different styles of the gif, playing with blur and other movement effects. After a few interations, I decided to stay with yellow no blur design to stick with the overall feeling of the website and to feel seemless with the current website design. I want the motion to not feel seperate from the ring boxes that the animation would sit behind.

## Interaction 2

The second iteraction animation I created was a splash effect that I learned about on Youtube. I wanted this animation to feel organic and feel connected to the current design of the website. I also wanted the animation to be triggered by the mouse clicking at any point of using the website as just a fun little boost of dopamine.
In order to make this animation, in short, I created one splash droplet, and then duplicated that mutliple times, changing each new droplets direction.

## Implementation

To implement each of these animations into my website, I started with exporting them as gifs, as this was the recommended way online. Once I had the gifs, I used cursor to add them into my current SilverWear website. This proved to be pretty easy with cursor as it worked with me to implement them into the specific part of my website. I worked with the code a little bit for each animation to adjust sizing for the hover animation and duration for the splash effect.

## Takeaways

Some of the biggest takeaways I learned were mainly around exporting the animation to be used on web. I wanted export the animations with transparent backgrounds and originally thought the only way to do it was with a Quicktime .mov file. This proved to be wrong when I took me 20 minutes of trying to get it to work on my website. Eventually I learned online that gif would be the best for quick quality animations and small data usage on the site.
